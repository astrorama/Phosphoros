#
# Conversion table from metalicity Z (in solar units) to number of ionized
# photons, normalized for the luminosity at 1500 Angstrom.
#
# This table is computed from the Starburst99 Dataset for each metalicity the
# following way:
# - The luminosity for the given metalicity value is taken from the continuous
#   Star Formation tables, assuming IMF=2.35 and age=10^8
# - The number of photons below 912 Angstrom is taken from the continuous Star
#   Formation tables, assuming IMF=2.35 and age=10^8
#

# Z/Z0  log(Qh/L1500)
